AI Career Coach

Entry point for the AI Career Coach application.

This module initializes the required services, knowledge base,
workflow components, and AI agents. It accepts career-related
queries from the user, routes each query to the appropriate
workflow, executes the selected multi-agent workflow, and
displays the final response.
